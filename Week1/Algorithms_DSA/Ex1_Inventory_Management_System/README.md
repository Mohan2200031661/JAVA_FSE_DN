# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management System

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project implements a simple and efficient **Inventory Management System** for a warehouse using object-oriented principles and appropriate data structures. 
It focuses on fast product lookup, addition, update, and deletionâ€”ideal for large-scale inventory operations.

## ðŸ§  1. Problem Understanding

Managing large inventories requires:
- **Efficient Data Access**: Quick retrieval and modification of products.
- **Scalability**: Handle growing product lists without performance loss.
- **Accuracy & Speed**: Real-time updates in systems like e-commerce or logistics.

**Why Data Structures Matter:**
- Poor data structures â†’ slower operations (e.g., O(n) search in arrays).
- Proper structures like `HashMap` allow constant-time operations.

## ðŸ§° 2. Suitable Data Structures

| Structure     | Pros                         | Cons                          |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ArrayList     | Maintains order              | O(n) for search/update/delete |
| LinkedList    | Easy insertion/deletion      | No direct access              |
| **HashMap**   | **O(1) average time ops**     | No order, possible collisions |

**âœ… Chosen Structure:**  
`HashMap<Integer, Product>`  
Using `productId` as key ensures fast, unique access.
